<p>
On October 21, 2025, in Brussels, Nino Inasaridze (TSU, GeBA) and Elena Cherkezia (TSU, GeBA) attended the first meeting of the newly launched COST Action CA24132 – “Accelerating Innovation and Development of European Microbial Foods (Mic2Food)”.
</p>

<p>
The Mic2Food network brought together researchers, industry representatives, and innovators from across Europe to support the development of next-generation microbial foods — including identification of safe strains, optimisation of fermentation processes, scale-up strategies, downstream processing, and navigation of regulatory frameworks.
</p>

<p>
Georgian representatives contributed to collaborative scientific activities, knowledge exchange, and capacity building aimed at supporting sustainable food innovation aligned with EU environmental and food safety goals.
