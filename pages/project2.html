<h2>DINARA-WELWET</h2>

<p><strong>Strengthening Youth Capacities in Wildlife Conservation Through One Health Initiatives and Virtual Reality Technology</strong></p>

<p><em>ERASMUS-YOUTH-2025-CB (Grant Agreement – under preparation)</em></p>

<p>
The DINARA-WELVET project addresses critical gaps in youth capacity building, digital skills, and employability in wildlife conservation, veterinary sciences, and One Health across Georgia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. Despite the increasing demand for trained professionals in biosecurity, biodiversity monitoring, and zoonotic disease prevention, young people in these fields struggle to access modern training, practical learning opportunities, and clear career pathways (FAO, 2021; OECD, 2023).
</p>

<p>
This disconnect between education and employment needs is limiting their ability to contribute effectively to conservation and public health efforts. DINARA-WELVET responds to this challenge with an innovative, hands-on, and technology-driven approach, aligning with Erasmus+ Capacity Building in Youth, the EU Youth Strategy (2019-2027), and the European Green Deal (European Commission, 2024).
</p>

<p>
The project integrates immersive VR-based training, AI-powered wildlife surveillance, digital biosecurity tools, and ecosystem restoration techniques to equip young professionals and students with the skills necessary for conservation careers in a rapidly evolving sector.
</p>

<p>
By training 500+ young people and strengthening 10+ youth organizations with advanced conservation tools, interdisciplinary environmental health strategies, and pathways into green entrepreneurship, DINARA-WELWET fosters youth leadership in biodiversity protection, climate resilience, and One Health security.
</p>

<p>
This initiative ensures long-term sustainability by bridging the gap between policy, education, and employment opportunities in conservation and public health (UNESCO, 2022).
