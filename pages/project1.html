<h2>Laboratory Health and Safety Lifelong Learning (LLL) Courses for Youth in West and East Georgia</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Laboratory Health and Safety LLL Courses for Youth in West and East Georgia</strong> project (2020â€“2023) was implemented with the direct support of the <strong>European Union</strong> under the Jobs4Skills Programme (ENI/2020/417-316). 
The initiative was led by a national consortium consisting of the <strong>Georgian Biotechnology Association (GeBA)</strong>, <strong>L. Sakvarelidze National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC)</strong>, 
<strong>State Laboratory of Agriculture (SLA)</strong>, and <strong>Tbilisi State University (TSU)</strong>, in close cooperation with EU partners â€” <strong>University of Teramo</strong> and <strong>University of Milan</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The project strengthened Georgiaâ€™s laboratory sector by improving the <strong>skills, knowledge, and employability of young professionals</strong> working in or aspiring to join laboratory services across the country.
</p>

<h3>Key Achievements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>New learning opportunities:</strong> Professional, accredited courses on Laboratory Health and Safety were developed and delivered in <strong>four Georgian universities</strong> in East and West Georgia, enabling 
    <strong>300 young specialists</strong> to gain practical, up-to-date skills demanded by laboratories, agro-food industries, healthcare institutions, and academic organizations.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Empowered trainers and institutions:</strong> Through a <strong>Training of Trainers (ToT)</strong> programme, universities, colleges, schools, and laboratory professionals strengthened their capacity to deliver 
    non-formal education in laboratory safety, ensuring long-term sustainability of the training model.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Universityâ€“industry collaboration:</strong> Internship programs were launched at <strong>four Georgian universities</strong> in cooperation with businesses providing testing and diagnostic services. 
    These opportunities offered students hands-on experience and improved transitions from education to employment.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Digital learning and networking tools:</strong> An <strong>online knowledge platform</strong> was launched to support local and international exchange, resource sharing, and collaboration in laboratory safety.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Career support and employability:</strong> An <strong>online employment and career guidance hub</strong> connected trained youth with employers, helping graduates enter the workforce.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<p>
The initiative contributed to a <strong>safer and stronger laboratory environment</strong> in Georgia, expanded lifelong learning opportunities for youth, and strengthened cooperation between education, research, and the labor market. 
As a result, many young professionals gained <strong>recognized qualifications</strong> and improved access to employment.
